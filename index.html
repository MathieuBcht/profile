                 <p>
                  I love serving this fondue when I have friends coming over. It only takes a few minutes to prepare! I prepare the sauces in advance so that they can chill, then I cut the beef just before my guests arrive. I have more time with my guests and no spending hours in the kitchen! In addition, this meal is delicious and the sauces are really tasty. I serve this fondue with boiled potatoes.
